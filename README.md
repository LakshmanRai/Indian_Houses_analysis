## Introduction

This project aims to perform data analysis on the Indian Houses Dataset using SQL queries. The dataset has been loaded into a SQL database, and various queries have been written to extract meaningful insights and answer specific questions about the data.

## Queries

Here are some of the SQL queries used for data analysis:

1. **Basic Dataset Information:**
   - Total number of records in the dataset

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Average price of houses
   - Highest and lowest prices of houses
   - Average area (square footage) of houses

3. **Filtering and Selection:**
   - Houses with more than 3 bedrooms
   - Houses with prices within a specific range

4. **Grouping and Aggregation:**
   - Average price of houses by city
   - City with the highest average price

5. **Data Exploration:**
   - Number of houses with parking
   - Most common type of house (e.g., apartment, villa)

## Data Exploration
